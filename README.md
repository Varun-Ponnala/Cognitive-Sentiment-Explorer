# Cognitive-Sentiment-Explorer

## Project Motivation
The Cognitive Sentiment Explorer analyzes textual data to uncover sentiment trends and cognitive themes over time.
It demonstrates how data cleaning, text processing, sentiment scoring, and clustering can be combined into an end-to-end cognitive analytics pipeline.

## Architecture (Pipeline Diagram)
Data Ingestion → Data Preprocessing and Analysis (pandas) → Text Processing (tokenization, stopwords)
→ Sentiment Analysis (VADER + custom lexicon) → Clustering (KMeans) -> Insights

## Data
Files uploaded on GitHub (csv and txt format)

## Methods
Python Basics

Variables, control flow, functions, exception handling
Mini challenges: Fibonacci sequence generator 

Data Cleaning with Pandas
Data handling

Text Processing

Custom tokenization without built-in split()
Stopword removal, term frequency calculation

Sentiment Analysis

VADER sentiment scoring (Positive / Neutral / Negative)
From-scratch lexicon-based scorer with negation handling


Clustering & Trends
KMeans clustering


## Tricky Problems Solved


## Key Findings
- [Summarize main results]

## Limitations
- [e.g., Language limitations, data representativity, bias, etc.]

## Next Steps
- [e.g., Improve model accuracy, expand data sources, deploy as web app]
